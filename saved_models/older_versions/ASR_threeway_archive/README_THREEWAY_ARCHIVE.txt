README_THREEWAY_ARCHIVE

2/26/25 - Aidan Kirchgraber
We found a problem with bird_mod_functions.R for the three-way models that was returning the same contrasts for urban open across months. Justin updated bird_mod_functions.R to address the problem and the three-way models had to be run again. This archive is the model results from the broken code, which I'm saving for the time being in case we want to look back at it for any reason.
